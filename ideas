- (this might be too complicated) use a random cat img generator to get random img & combine with random quote, so end up using 2 APIs..... 
    - similar idea but combine NASA image of the day https://api.nasa.gov/ (as background image?) plus random quotes (combine with Heather's quote idea? or affirmations lol )
